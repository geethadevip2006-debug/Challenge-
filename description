A thyroid test is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the function of the thyroid gland, which plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, 
energy levels, and overall hormonal balance. This test typically measures levels of key hormones such as T3 (triiodothyronine), T4 (thyroxine),
and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) in the blood. Abnormal levels may indicate conditions like hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or autoimmune
disorders such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’ disease. Thyroid testing is often recommended when patients experience symptoms like fatigue,
weight changes, mood swings, or irregular heart rate. Early detection through these tests allows for timely treatment and better management of thyroid-related health issues.
